    "content": "If you're looking for an authentic Taiwanese breakfast experience, Yong He Soy Milk King (永和豆漿大王) is a must-visit spot. This popular eatery is known for its classic Taiwanese breakfast items, served fresh and delicious, even late into the night. Having visited many times, I've had the chance to try a variety of dishes. Here’s my take on some of their best offerings! <br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/><p><b>The Atmosphere</b></p><br/> Every time I visit, the shop is buzzing with both locals and tourists, all eager to get their hands on fresh breakfast. It’s a fast-paced place—you order, grab your food, and find a seat, often sharing tables with strangers. I love how it feels so authentic and lively, like stepping into the heart of Taiwan’s morning culture.",

    "content": "The first time I ordered food in Taiwan was a new experience for me. Since I couldn’t read the menu, I took a picture of the dish I wanted. When it was my turn, I showed the picture to the staff and said, \"我要這個!\" (I want this one!). Thankfully, they understood, and I got my meal. <br/><br/> As I was eating, I suddenly felt like someone was watching me. I looked around and saw a little boy staring at me. When our eyes met, he smiled. I wasn’t sure why—maybe he was just curious—but I smiled back, took a few pictures, and continued my meal.<br/><br/><hr/><br/> 我第一次在臺灣點餐是一個新的體驗。因為我看不懂菜單，我拍了我想要的菜的照片。該到我的時候，我給店員看照片，然後說：「我要這個！」。他們明白了，我拿到了我的餐。當我在吃飯時，我突然覺得好像有人在看我。我周圍看看，看到一個小男孩看著我。當我們的眼神碰到時，他笑了。我不確定為什麼—也許他只是好奇—但我回了笑，拍了幾張照片，然後繼續吃我的飯。",

    "content": "Back in 2022, I made a bold move—I quit my job and flew to Taiwan to learn Chinese. Sounds adventurous, right? Well, before I could immerse myself in the language, I first had to immerse myself in... hotel quarantine. Ten days. Just me, my room, and three mystery meals delivered daily. </br></br> Now, I had heard all sorts of things about quarantine meals. Some people claimed they were great. Others? Different experiences. So, I decided to document my own experience—ten days of culinary surprises. I took a picture of every single meal, because if I had to go through this, the world should see it too. </br></br> <b>What's on the Menu?</b> Imagine opening a meal box every day like it's a mystery gift. Will it be a delightful discovery or an unexpected twist? Rice—check. A protein—check. Vegetables—check. Some uniquely interesting side dish—double check. Each meal came with an element of surprise, like playing food roulette. </br></br> Some meals were incredibly delicious. Others sparked curiosity. There were days when I felt like a king feasting and days when I embraced new flavors, expanding my culinary appreciation.</br></br> <b>Lessons Learned</b> <ol><li><b>Expect the unexpected:</b>One day it’s delicious braised chicken, the next it’s a fish dish full of character.</li></ol> </br></br>By the time my quarantine ended, I was free, filled with new culinary experiences, and definitely well-fed. If you’re ever in a similar situation, just remember: embrace the mystery, take pictures, and always have snacks on standby!",
