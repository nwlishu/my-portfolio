    "content": "<p><b>The Spicy History of Malatang</b></p><br/>Malatang (麻辣烫) originates from Sichuan, China, and has a long history as a convenient and flavorful street food. It is said that boatmen along the Yangtze River first created malatang to stay warm, using a pot of boiling broth infused with Sichuan peppercorns and chilies. Over time, this evolved into the modern malatang we love today—where diners choose their own ingredients and enjoy a rich, spicy, numbing broth that brings heat and comfort in every bite. <br/><br/> <p><b>My Malatang Collection in Taiwan</b></p><br/>If there’s one dish that keeps me coming back for more, it’s malatang! I’ve visited many spots in Taiwan, and each experience is a spicy adventure filled with bold flavors and endless ingredient combinations.<br/><br/>The moment you step into a malatang eatery, the rich aroma of chili and Sichuan pepper fills the air. The process is simple yet exciting—grab a bowl, pick from a variety of fresh vegetables, meats, tofu, and noodles, and then watch as everything is cooked in a deeply flavorful broth. The signature broth is the perfect balance of numbing spiciness and savory depth, making every bite absolutely addictive.<br/><br/>One of my favorite parts about enjoying malatang in Taiwan is the incredible ingredient selection. I always go for tofu skin, three eggs, and a variety of fresh vegetables. These ingredients soak up the broth beautifully, making each bite rich and flavorful without the need for meat.<br/><br/>Every visit is a new experience, yet the same comforting satisfaction keeps me coming back. The fiery broth, the tingle of Sichuan pepper on my tongue, and the customizable bowls make malatang a dish that never gets old.<br/><br/>If you’re in Taiwan and craving a comforting yet bold dish, I highly recommend trying malatang. Just be ready for the addictive heat that will keep you coming back for more!",

    "content": "The first time I ordered food in Taiwan was a new experience for me. Since I couldn’t read the menu, I took a picture of the dish I wanted. When it was my turn, I showed the picture to the staff and said, \"我要這個!\" (I want this one!). Thankfully, they understood, and I got my meal. <br/><br/> As I was eating, I suddenly felt like someone was watching me. I looked around and saw a little boy staring at me. When our eyes met, he smiled. I wasn’t sure why—maybe he was just curious—but I smiled back, took a few pictures, and continued my meal.<br/><br/><hr/><br/> 我第一次在臺灣點餐是一個新的體驗。因為我看不懂菜單，我拍了我想要的菜的照片。該到我的時候，我給店員看照片，然後說：「我要這個！」。他們明白了，我拿到了我的餐。當我在吃飯時，我突然覺得好像有人在看我。我周圍看看，看到一個小男孩看著我。當我們的眼神碰到時，他笑了。我不確定為什麼—也許他只是好奇—但我回了笑，拍了幾張照片，然後繼續吃我的飯。",

    "content": "Back in 2022, I made a bold move—I quit my job and flew to Taiwan to learn Chinese. Sounds adventurous, right? Well, before I could immerse myself in the language, I first had to immerse myself in... hotel quarantine. Ten days. Just me, my room, and three mystery meals delivered daily. </br></br> Now, I had heard all sorts of things about quarantine meals. Some people claimed they were great. Others? Different experiences. So, I decided to document my own experience—ten days of culinary surprises. I took a picture of every single meal, because if I had to go through this, the world should see it too. </br></br> <b>What's on the Menu?</b> Imagine opening a meal box every day like it's a mystery gift. Will it be a delightful discovery or an unexpected twist? Rice—check. A protein—check. Vegetables—check. Some uniquely interesting side dish—double check. Each meal came with an element of surprise, like playing food roulette. </br></br> Some meals were incredibly delicious. Others sparked curiosity. There were days when I felt like a king feasting and days when I embraced new flavors, expanding my culinary appreciation.</br></br> <b>Lessons Learned</b> <ol><li><b>Expect the unexpected:</b>One day it’s delicious braised chicken, the next it’s a fish dish full of character.</li></ol> </br></br>By the time my quarantine ended, I was free, filled with new culinary experiences, and definitely well-fed. If you’re ever in a similar situation, just remember: embrace the mystery, take pictures, and always have snacks on standby!",
